# Introduction II

Within the second session we'll start exploring this thing called "the computer" a bit more, specifically two aspects that might seem adjacent to utilizing `python` within research workflows but are actually crucial components: the `(bash) shell` and `computing environments`. Don't worry: this will also entail hands-on programming, just no directly in `python`. The things covered in this session will introduce central concepts for our subsequent endeavors.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.
