# Introduction VII

Within the seventh session we'll continue to explore the basic building blocks of `python`, this and the next `session` will contain exhaustive content aiming to provide you with a somewhat detailed understanding of central `python` aspects. The aim is to get a good set of basic experience to then advance into more practical aspects, specifically evaluating how these things can be utilized within `experiments` to collect data and their subsequent `analyzes`. To nevertheless get some experience on the way, there will be some exercise at the beginning and throughout the session. Additionally, the `homework assignments` will be made in a way that showcases some tasks that you might most likely encounter in real-life so that you get more practice in conducting them through `python`.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.


### Introduction to Python - II
This session, we'll build upon the things learn last week and broader our capabilities in `python`, focusing on `indentation` and `control flow & structures`. 

#### Objectives 📍

- learn about `indentation` (some form of `code structuring`)
- `control` how our `code` is `executed`
  - `Conditionals` (`if` - `else` `statements`)
  - `Iteration` (e.g., `for-loops`, `while statements`, …)
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Introduction VII - Introduction to Python III](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/introduction/intro_python_III.html) in the `ToC` on the left.
