# Introduction VI

Within the sixth session we'll continue to explore the basic building blocks of `python`, this and the next `session` will contain exhaustive content aiming to provide you with a somewhat detailed understanding of central `python` aspects. The aim is to get a good set of basic experience to then advance into more practical aspects, specifically evaluating how these things can be utilized within `experiments` to collect data and their subsequent `analyzes`. To nevertheless get some experience on the way, there will be some exercise at the beginning and throughout the session. Additionally, the `homework assignments` will be made in a way that showcases some tasks that you might most likely encounter in real-life so that you get more practice in conducting them through `python`.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.


### Introduction to Python - II
This session, we'll build upon the things learn last week and broader our capabilities in `python`, focusing on `operations`, `comparisons` and `data types`/`structures`. 

#### Objectives 📍

- learn basic and efficient usage of the `python` programming language
  - what is `python` & how to utilize it
  - `operations` & `comparison` in `python`
  - `data types` & `structures`
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Introduction VI - Introduction to Python II](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/introduction/intro_python_II.html) in the `ToC` on the left.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

Your fourth homework assignment will entail working through a few tasks covering the contents discussed in this session within of a `jupyter notebook`. You can download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x2suy8dfcmb3yuf/PFP_assignment_4_intro_python_2.ipynb?dl=1). In order to open it, put the `homework assignment notebook` within the folder you stored the `course materials`, start a `jupyter notebook` as during the sessions, navigate to the `homework assignment notebook`, open it and have fun! NB: a substantial part of it will be _optional_ and thus the notebook will look way longer than it actually is.

**Deadline: 15/12/2021, 11:59 PM EST**
