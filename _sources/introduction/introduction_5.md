# Introduction V

Within the fifth session we'll continue to explore `jupyter notebooks` as a central tool, resource and prerequisite for future endeavors as all of the `introduction to python`, as well as `data analyzes part` will be conducted within them.  Subsequently, we start working with the `python` programming language, as well as situate and compare it to other programming languages.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Transition to virtual classes


#### Objectives 📍
- outline transition to virtual classes
- discuss new setup

### Jupyter notebooks
During the previous session we had a look at different ways of communicating with our computers. Generally speaking we could either use a `GUI` or a `CLI`. In more detail we also have different options to utilize the same `programming language` to communicate with our `computer`, e.g. the `shell`, `jupyter notebooks` and `IDE`s. After we already explored the `shell` a bit, we'll now spend a closer look at `jupyter notebook` and how we can work with them. This is a central topic as the `python introduction` and `data analyzes` parts of the course will be conducted via `jupyter notebook` and you'll have to hand in most assignments via them as well.  

#### Objectives 📍

- learn basic and efficient usage of the jupyter ecosystem & notebooks
    - what is Jupyter & how to utilize jupyter notebooks
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Introduction IV - jupyter notebooks](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/introduction/intro_jupyter.html) in the `ToC` on the left.


### Introduction to Python - I
The big moment is finally here: after spending quite a bit of time exploring important concepts adjacent to/around `python`, with the intention to provide a holistic understanding and situate components accordingly, we will start exploring `python` itself. Within the first block of programming with `python` we will go through basics of the `python` programming language, its central aspects and building blocks, as well as its benefits generally speaking and within the context of psychology research.

#### Objectives 📍

- learn basic and efficient usage of the python programming language
  - what is python & how to utilize it
  - building blocks of & operations in python
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

Not applicable, as project related work didn't start yet.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

I unfortunately didn't explain things properly at the end of last week's session and thus some folks already did the second homework assignment and some don't. I'm truly sorry for that! Those folks that already did it obviously don't have to repeat it, for the others, please find the information below: 

Your second homework assignment will entail the generation of a `jupyter notebook` with
- **mandatory**: 3 different cells:
  - 1 rendered markdown cell within which you name your favorite movie and describe why you like it via
    max. 2 sentences
  - 1 code cell with an equation (e.g. `1+1`, `(a+b)/(c+d)`, etc.)
  - 1 raw cell with your favorite snack 
- **optional**: a picture of your favorite animal
Once you have everything, save the notebook and e-mail it to Peer.

Please note that the deadline for the assignment is: 01/12/2021, 11:59 PM EST.
