# Experiments I


## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.


### Introduction to PsychoPy - II
This session, we'll build upon the things learn last week and broader our capabilities in `python`, focusing on `operations`, `comparisons` and `data types`/`structures`. 

#### Objectives 📍

- running `experiments` using `python`
    - Exploring `PsychoPy`
    - basic setup & interaction
    - experiments, trials, stimuli, responses
    - a very simple experiment
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

There are two different sets of materials for this topic. A `slide deck` and a `jupyter notebook`.

You can find the `slides` here:

And the `jupyter notebook` which contains a condensed version of the `slides` in the `ToC` on the left via

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

The assignment for next week (#6) will have **three parts**:


- create and populate a `Readme.md` file via the `terminal` and `VScode` 
    - so far we didn’t add any documentation on what our experiment is about and how to run it please create the respective file in the same directory via `touch filename` open it in `VScode` and provide some basic information about and how people can run it

- add the remaining `list`s of stimuli to the `experiment`: `snacks` and `animals`
    - copy/adapt the steps we did for the movies (`create list`, `shuffle`)
    - create one `list` with all stimuli and bring it into the required format (`list_all = list_1 + list_2 + list_3`, `for stim in list_all`)

- take part in the `experiment` and provide honest answers/responses
    - conduct the `experiment` as a naive `participant`
    - save the `output file` in a new folder called `data` that is within the `experiment` folder    

Once you finished all **three parts**, please `compress` the `experiment folder` (e.g. via `right click on the folder` -> `compress`/`zip`/etc. or the `terminal`) and send it to Peer.
