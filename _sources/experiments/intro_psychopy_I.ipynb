Lucky for us `Python` makes it easy to `create` and `manage` `computing environments`, for example using [conda]().\n",

Creating a new `directory` as no biggie using `bash`, we can simply use `mkdir` and specify the wanted `path` and `name`. For the sake of simplicity, let's put everything in a folder called `psychopy_experiment` on our `Desktop`s. "

    "If you don't get an `import error`, at least the basic `installation` should be ok!\n",

    "Cool, we are now ready to actually do some `coding`! As said before we will do that in our `experiment.py` `script`. While the transition from `jupyter notebooks` to `python scripts` might seem harsh at first, it’s actually straight-forward: the steps we conducted/`commands` we `run` in an incremental fashion will also be indicated/`run` in an incremental fashion here, just within one `python script` line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's the first thing we usually do? That's right: `import`ing `modules` and `function`s we need. Comparably to `jupyter notebook`, we will do that at the beginning of our `script`. Please note, that we will go through a realistic example of `coding` `experiments` in `python` and thus might not all `modules`/`functions` we will actually need when we start. Thus, we will add them at the beginning as we go along!\n",

We can implement this crucial aspect via the [psychopy.gui module](https://psychopy.org/api/gui.html).

    "## PsychoPy working principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we came across one of `PsychoPy`’s core working principles: we need a `general experiment window`, i.e. a place we can display/present something on. You can define a variety of different `windows` based on different `screens`/`monitors` which should however be adapted to the `setup` and `experiment` at hand (e.g. `size`, `background color`, etc.). Basically all `experiments` you will set up will require to define a `general experiment window` as without it no `visual stimuli` (e.g. `images`, `text`, `movies`, etc.) can be displayed/presented or how `PsychoPy` would say it: `drawn`\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of which: this is the next core working principle we are going to see and explore is the difference between `draw`ing something and showing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Draw`ing & `flip`ping\n",
    "\n",
    "In `PsychoPy` (and many other comparable software) there’s a big difference between `draw`ing and showing something. While we need to `draw` something on/in a `window` that alone won’t actually show it. This is because `PsychoPy` internally uses `“two screens”` one `background` or `buffer` `screen` which is not seen (yet) and one `front screen` which is (currently) seen. When you `draw` something it’s always going to be `draw`n on the `background`/`buffer` `screen`, thus “invisible” and you need to `flip` it to the `front screen` to be “visible”.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/master/lecture/static/draw_flip.png\" alt=\"logo\" title=\"jupyter\" width=\"600\" height=\"100\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "Why does `PsychoPy` (and other comparable software) work like that? The idea/aim is always the same: increase performance and minimize delays (as addressed in the [slides]()). `Draw`ing something might take a long time, depending on the stimulus at hand, but `flip`ping something already drawn from the `buffer` to the `front screen` is fast(er). It can thus ensure better and more precise timing. This can work comparably for `images`, `sounds`, `movies`, etc. where things are set/`draw`n/pre-loaded and presented exactly when needed.  "

In `PsychoPy` this is achieved via the [data.TrialHandler()](https://psychopy.org/api/data.html#psychopy.data.TrialHandler) `function` for which we need to convert our `shuffle`d `stimuli list` into a `list` of `dictionaries` of the form `“stimulus”: value`.\n",
