# Analyses II
With this session, we conclude the final chapter of our endeavor. After spending quite a good while on `basic data handling` and `data wrangling`, we will continue with `data visualization` and `data analyses` using `python`. This includes a brief showcase of several distinct aspects/steps in a "classic" data analyses workflow: `data visualization` for `explorative and statistical purposes`, as well as `statistical analyses`. As usual the aim is to provide folks a respective overview that allows them to dig further into details and start using `python` for their `data analyses` after the course ends.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.


### Introduction to Data analyses - II
Sure, most of us already conducted some analyses here and there but did you already make use of the fantastic world of `data analyzes` using `python` with its tremendously powerful go-to `modules` and basically unlimited amount of highly specialized `libraries`? No matter what you're looking for and want to work on, `python`'s got your back! Given the short amount of time we have, this session will focus on one of the central `modules` concerning `data visualization` and `statistical analyses`. In more detail, we will `visualize` and `analyse` the `data` we obtained during the `PsychoPy` sessions via different means.        

#### Objectives 📍

- learn basic and efficient usage of python for data analyzes & visualization
    - working with data: 
        - reading, working, writing
        - preprocessing, filtering, wrangling
    - visualizing data:
        - basic plots
        - advanced & fancy stuff
    - statistical analyses    
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Data analyzes II - data visualization and analyses](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/analyses/intro_data_analyzes_visualization_II.html) in the `ToC` on the left.



## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

Your ninth homework assignment will entail working through a few tasks covering the contents discussed in this session within of a `jupyter notebook`. You can download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8onpnvjap5yejnd/PFP_assignment_9_intro_analyzes_II.ipynb?dl=1). In order to open it, put the `homework assignment notebook` within the folder you stored the `course materials`, start a `jupyter notebook` as during the sessions, navigate to the `homework assignment notebook`, open it and have fun!  

**Deadline: 16/02/2022, 11:59 PM EST**

_Optional_: If you are interested in using `python` for a specific task/problem/analyses/etc. or have general questions, please send us a message before the class or outline them to ask during the class, as we will do a general Q&A and provide some pointers on how to continue and extent your `python` adventures! 

### optional/reading/further materials

Here's a cool add-on to further familiarize yourself with `seaborn` and its capabilities.
