# Analyses I
With this session, we have reached the final chapter of our endeavor. After spending quite a good while on important prerequisites concerning scientific computing and the basics of the `python` programming language and a short excurse to running `experiments` using `PsychoPy`, we will now spend a look at `data analyses` using `python`. This includes a brief showcase of several distinct aspects/steps in a "classic" data analyses workflow: `basic data handling` (reading, wrangling, writing), `data visualization` and `statistical analyses`. As usual the aim is to provide folks a respective overview that allows them to dig further into details and start using `python` for their `data analyses` after the course ends.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.


### Introduction to Data analyses - I
Sure, most of us already conducted some analyses here and there but did you already make use of the fantastic world of `data analyzes` using `python` with its tremendously powerful go-to `modules` and basically unlimited amount of highly specifialized libraries? No matter what you're looking for and want to work on, `python`'s got your back! Given the short amount of time we have, this session will focus on one of the central `modules` concerning working with data: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). In more detail, we will check the `data` we obtained during the `PsychoPy` sessions via going through several core steps of `data analyes` using `pandas`.        

#### Objectives 📍

- learn basic and efficient usage of python for data analyzes & visualization
    - working with data: 
        - reading, working, writing
        - preprocessing, filtering, wrangling
    - visualizing data:
        - basic plots
        - advanced & fancy stuff
    - statistical analyses    
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Data analyzes I - basics in data handling](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/analyses/intro_data_analyzes_visualization.html) in the `ToC` on the left.



## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

Your eight homework assignment will entail working through a few tasks covering the contents discussed in this session within of a `jupyter notebook`. You can download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tvnatrn1lxnw0gv/PFP_assignment_8_intro_analyzes.ipynb?dl=1). In order to open it, put the `homework assignment notebook` within the folder you stored the `course materials`, start a `jupyter notebook` as during the sessions, navigate to the `homework assignment notebook`, open it and have fun!  

**Deadline: 02/02/2022, 11:59 PM EST**

### optional/reading/further materials

Here are some cool add-ons to further familiarize yourself with `pandas` and its capabilities.

Make sure to check the amazing [10 minutes to pandas]() tutorial that covers a lot of important functionality!
