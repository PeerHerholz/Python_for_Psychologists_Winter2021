# Experiments I (alternate timeline)
Last week's session that rather was a disaster...specifically the parts where we tried to code our `experiment`. The problem was situated in the installation of the required `computing environment` and for the `windows OS` folks, the interaction of the tools we tried to use: `WSL`, `conda` and `vscode`. TL;DR: basically nothing really worked and we couldn't try out `pyschopy`. However, to still showcase tiny bits and provide some insights, we will travel back in time and create an alternate/branched timeline for the `Experiments` part of the course. In short, we will use [PsychoPy's standalone version](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html#download) rather than using the tools we've explored so far in order to allow everyone interested to participate.   

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.


### Introduction to PsychoPy - I - alternate timeline
As mentioned above, this content is situated in the alternate timeline of the `Experiments` parts of the `course`. To get some idea of how to run `experiments` via `python`, we will explore the `python library` [PsychoPy]() via its [standalone version](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html#download). This will include its setup, basic working principles, as well as advantages and disadvantages, showcased on a very simple experiment. 

#### Objectives 📍

- running `experiments` using `python`
    - Exploring `PsychoPy`
    - basic setup & interaction
    - experiments, trials, stimuli, responses
    - a very simple experiment
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

You can find the `slides` here:

Please also consult the `jupyter notebook` which contains a condensed version of the `python code` written without the `builder interface`: [Experimentation I - Introduction to PsychoPy I](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/introduction/intro_psychopy_I.html) .


## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

There will be **three** subparts within this assignment: 

- populate the readme.md file via VScode
    - so far we didn’t add any documentation on what our experiment is about and how to run it
    - please open the readme.md file PsychoPy created in VScode and provide some basic information about it and how people can run it

- add the remaining lists of stimuli to the experiment: snacks and animals
    - copy/adapt the steps we did for the movies (create routine, add components to routine, create csv file with stimuli, etc.)
    - follow the respective steps and only adapt what’s necessary (question, explanation, stimuli list/file)

- take part in the experiment and provide honest answers/responses
    - conduct the experiment as a naive participant with a “funny ID” (please keep it civil)

Once you finished all three parts, please compress the `psychop_experiment folder` (e.g. via right click on the folder -> compress/zip/etc. or the terminal) and send it to Peer.

**Deadline: 26/01/2022, 11:59 PM EST**


### optional/reading/further materials

Here are some cool videos providing some further insights into the world and capabilities of `PsychoPy`.

First, a nice introduction to everything `PsychoPy` from the `standalone/builder perspective`.

And a nice tutorial on how to implement the `Simon Task` in `PsychoPy`.
