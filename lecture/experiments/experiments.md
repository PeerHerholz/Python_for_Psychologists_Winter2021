# Running experiments in Python

### Schedule

Please see below for our current optimistic schedule. Depending on our progress, potential problems and different forms of learning, content and times might change a bit. Each lecture will be divided into several parts separated by a 5-10 minute break and might constitute a transition from basic to advanced concepts, theoretic to practical sessions and individual to group work. The different parts are roughly indicated in the schedule below like this:

🗓 - important information on date & time  
💡 - input from the instructor  
👨🏻‍🏫 - instructor presents content  
🥼 - research project work  
🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻 - work on demo data  
🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬 - work on own research project  
🖥️ - computational work outside course hours  
✍🏽 - writing outside course hours  
📖 - reading outside course hours
