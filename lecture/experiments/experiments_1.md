# Experiments I
After spending quite a good while on important prerequisites concerning scientific computing and the basics of the `python` programming language, it's finally time to combine them via transitioning to more applied topics. This adventure will start with a brief exploration of how to create and run experiments using [PsychoPy](), a `python library` dedicated to conducting experiments in the realm of `psychology` and adjacent fields. Due to time constraints we will only spend a quick look at things and showcase the most important aspects to allow folks to explore things further after the course ends.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.


### Introduction to PsychoPy - I
Most of us already conducted one or the other experiment. However, there's a fair number of different software options and tools out there, which mostly depends on the computational infrastructure at hand but also on what people are used to. That being said: what options are roughly out there and can we actually use `python` based resources concerning experiments with a clear conscience? To get some idea we will explore the `python library` [PsychoPy](), including its setup, basic working principles, as well as advantages and disadvantages, showcased on a very simple experiment. Buckle up y'all, this is the first time we will use `python` "in the wild".      

#### Objectives 📍

- running `experiments` using `python`
    - Exploring `PsychoPy`
    - basic setup & interaction
    - experiments, trials, stimuli, responses
    - a very simple experiment
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

There are two different sets of materials for this topic. A `slide deck` and a `jupyter notebook`.

You can find the `slides` here:

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

Given our limited success in getting things to work during the session, there will be no assignments for next week. 


### optional/reading/further materials

Here are some cool videos providing some further insights into the world and capabilities of `PsychoPy`.

First, a nice tutorial on how to create a “`line bisection task`” using `PsychoPy`.

Want to know how far you can go with `PsychoPy`? How about coding an entire video game? Yeah, that's possible!
