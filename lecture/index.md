Hello everyone and welcome to the course page for "Python for Psychologists", taught
within the [Psychology master programme](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/51789866/Institute_of_Psychology?) of the [Goethe-University Frankfurt](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en) during the winter term 2021. We're glad to see you here!

Within these pages, we provide the all information important to follow and conduct the course, including formal aspects, requirements, lecture materials, practicals and so on.  This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) will include the used slides and code in a way that they can be explored in an interactive manner. You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. The three symbols in the top allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying [Github repository]() and allow you to download the contents as a pdf or [jupyter notebook]() respectively. Some sections will additionally have a little rocket in that row which will allow you to interactively rerun certain parts of the practicals via cloud computing. Additionally, we support public reviews and comments through an [hypothes.is]() plugin with which you can interact on the right side. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the [Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/), specifically, the [Executable/Jupyter Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) and [mybinder project](https://mybinder.org/).

## Python for Psychologists

This course is designed to provide lecture content in a way that it 
is [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) for as
many people as possible.

You can use the following sections to navigate through the content of the lecture:

* [Overview & procedure ](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/overview.html)

   What's this course all about? How are things implemented and supposed to work? 

* [General outline](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/outline.html)

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Introduction](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/introduction/introduction.html)

   All things gotta start somewhere and using programming within research settings is no exception to
   that, but how?

* [Running experiments in Python](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/experiments/experiments.html#)

   How can you use python to conduct experiments to acquire data from participants? 

* [Data analyses in Python](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/analyses/analyses.html)

   How can you use python to obtain insights from data, including preprocessing, statistics and visualizations? 

* [Student projects](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/projects.html)

   Making sure the work and progress of the participants is transparent and
   documented.

* [Questionnaires](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/questionnaires.html)

   Was it worth it and how can this be evaluated?

* [Code of Conduct](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.
