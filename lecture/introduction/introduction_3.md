# Introduction III

Within the second session we'll continue with the sections from last week, that is exploring this thing called "the computer" a bit more, specifically one aspect that might seem adjacent to utilizing `python` within research workflows but is actually a crucial component: `computing environments`. Don't worry: this will also entail hands-on programming, just not directly in `python`. The things covered in this session will introduce central concepts for our subsequent endeavors. For example, also the ones we will cover in the second part of the session, that is `jupyter notebooks` and finally `python`.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Computing environments


#### Objectives 📍

Please download the example script [fancy_analyzes.py](https://www.dropbox.com/s/52q11h8r5oj8ocg/fancy_analyzes.py?dl=1).

#### Materials 📓

### Jupyter notebooks



#### Objectives 📍

- learn basic and efficient usage of the shell for various tasks
    - navigating directories
    - file handling: copy, paste, create, delete

#### Materials 📓

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook`[Introduction III - jupyter notebooks](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/introduction/intro_jupyter.html) in the `ToC` on the left.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

Your first homework assignment will entail the generation of a `conda environment` within which our `fancy_analyzes.py` can run & sending us the corresponding `environment.yml` via e-mail. 

Your second homework assignment will entail the generation of a jupyter notebook with
- **mandatory**: 3 different cells:
  - 1 rendered markdown cell within which you name your favorite movie and describe why you like it via  
    max. 2 sentences
  - 1 code cell with an equation (e.g. `1+1`, `(a+b)/(c+d)`, etc.)
  - 1 raw cell with your favorite snack 
- **optional**: a picture of your favorite animal
Once you have everything, save the notebook and e-mail it to Peer.

Please note that the deadline for both assignments is: 17/11/2021, 11:59 PM EST.
