# Introduction II

Within the second session we'll start exploring this thing called "the computer" a bit more, specifically two aspects that might seem adjacent to utilizing `python` within research workflows but are actually crucial components: the `(bash) shell` and `computing environments`. Don't worry: this will also entail hands-on programming, just no directly in `python`. The things covered in this session will introduce central concepts for our subsequent endeavors.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### You & your computer


#### Objectives 📍

- Learn about different ways of interacting with computers
- GUI, CLI, IDEs 
- test different options on your machines
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

### The (bash) shell

Please download the [example dataset provided here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip).

#### Objectives 📍

- learn basic and efficient usage of the shell for various tasks
    - navigating directories
    - file handling: copy, paste, create, delete

#### Materials 📓

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook`[Introduction II - the (unix) command line: bash](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/introduction/intro_to_shell.html) in the `ToC` on the left.

### Computing environments


#### Objectives 📍

Please download the example script [fancy_analyzes.py](https://www.dropbox.com/s/52q11h8r5oj8ocg/fancy_analyzes.py?dl=1).

## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

Not applicable, as project related work didn't start yet.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

Your first homework assignment will entail the generation of a `conda environment` within which our `fancy_analyzes.py` can run & sending us the corresponding `environment.yml` via e-mail. Please note the deadline: 08/11/2021, 11:59 PM EST.
