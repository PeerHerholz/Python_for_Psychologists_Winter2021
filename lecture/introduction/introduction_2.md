# Introduction II

Within the second session we'll start exploring this thing called "the computer" a bit more, specifically two aspects that might seem adjacent to utilizing `python` within research workflows but are actually crucial components: `CLIs/IDEs`  and `(bash) shell`. Don't worry: this will also entail hands-on programming, just not directly in `python`. The things covered in this session will introduce central concepts for our subsequent endeavors.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### You & your computer
How do you interact with your computer? In general, you as a user provide some `input` that contains a `task` that your `computer` should perform in order to obtain a desired `outcome`. However, there are different ways you can approach this, each with advantages and disadvantages. More precisely this refers to the distinction between `GUI`s and `CLI`s. Within this part of the session we'll discuss both a bit and also talk about different options to utilize `programming languages`. 

#### Objectives 📍

- Learn about different ways of interacting with computers
- GUI, CLI, IDEs 
- test different options on your machines
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

### The (bash) shell



#### Objectives 📍

- learn basic and efficient usage of the shell for various tasks
    - navigating directories
    - file handling: copy, paste, create, delete
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time
